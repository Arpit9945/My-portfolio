                    I originally went to school to become an elementary teacher.
                    When I Joined College, I realized that my real passion is in
                    tech. I want to make a difference in the world and web
                    development is a place I can do that through creating
                    beautiful and meaningful websites.
                    When I'm not coding,
                    you can find me hanging with my dogs,
                    reading a book, or spending time with
                    my friends and family.</h5>

            </div>
